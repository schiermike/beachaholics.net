Beachaholics.net
================

This repo contains a bunch of PHP code that drives my Volleyball club's home page [beachaholics.net][beachaholics]. 

If you want to get an impression of how web apps should **not** be architected, feel free to dive into this one. No ORM was used, no templating language, just plain SQL, PHP, and bits and pieces of Javascript.
